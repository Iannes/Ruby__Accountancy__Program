# Ruby__Accountancy__Program
This program was created as an exercise, when I was learning the basics of programming using Ruby. 

User creates a new client's profile by adding client's name, their opening account balance, client's credit and debit. 
The program displays input back to the user, calculates the remaining balance 
and asks the user to save the data in an xslx file.
